<h2>Title:</h2>
Basics of Working with Mouse. GDI Primitives. Bezier Curve.
<h2>IDE:</h2> Microsoft Visual Studio

<h2> Mandatory Objectives </h2>
- Draw few lines of different colors and weights
-  Draw a Bezier curve
- Draw few plane objects (ex. circle, square, pie, polygon...) of different colors, weights, filled and not
- Draw 2 different objects using mouse

<h2> Objectives with points </h2>
- Draw a custom bitmap image <b>(1 pt)</b>
- Add a switch (button, select list...) that will change mouse ability to draw objects <b>(2 pt)</b>
- Draw a Bezier curve using mouse <b>(1 pt)</b>
- Fill an object with a gradient <b>(1 pt)</b>

<h2> App Functionality: </h2>
In this app you can draw lines,rectangles,ellipses with your mouse but without any preview. Also the border and filled color,width parameters are adjustable.

<h2> Conclusion: </h2>
By performing 3rd laboratory work , we learned how to handle mouse events and to draw simple things such as rectangles and lines. Interactive drawing is much more difficult so in this case we don't have any preview when we draw objects by using mouse.

<h2> Mandatory Objectives </h2>
- Create a Windows application
-  Choose a Programming Style Guideline that you'll follow
- Add 2 buttons to window: one with default styles, one with custom styles (size, background, text color, font family, font size) 
- Add 2 text inputs to window: one with default styles, one with custom styles (size, background, text color, font family, font size)
- Add 2 text elements to window: one with default styles, one with custom styles (size, background, text color, font family, font size)
 
<h2> Objectives with points </h2>
- Make elements to fit window on resize (1 pt) (hint: you can limit minimal window width and height)
- Make elements to interact or change other elements (1 pt for 2 different interactions) (0-2 pt) (ex. on button click, change text element color or position)
- Change behavior of different window actions (at least 3). For ex.: on clicking close button, move window to a random location on display's working space (1 pt)

<h2> App functionality: </h2>
In this simple application we can type in textboxes and by pressing the directional buttons, we can move the content from one to another. Also the window control buttons act a little bit different comparing to the default actions. The elements from the window can resize and the minimal window size is limited to 700x500 pixels.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
In this laboratory work we learned how a Win32 application works. It was a little bit difficult at the begining because there is a lot of code for the window creation which you cannot remember. Also it's much more difficult to create visual elements by writing code than using drag and drop elements. You don't get any preview of the program and you have to compile and run it every time when you make some changes.
